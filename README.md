# Portfolio site - Udacity FEND course project nr.1

## Purpose

The main goal was to create a responsive site using css and html. I got a mockup as a starting point and I wrote the code from the scratch.

## Info about the site

* It is responsive in all viewports.
* JS is used for a hamburger menu.
* If you click one of the images in main section, you will open again the same site.
* Images in the footer are real, so if you want to contact me (via gmail or linkedin) feel free to use it.
